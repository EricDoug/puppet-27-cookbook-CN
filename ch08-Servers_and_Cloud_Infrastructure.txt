[[chapter08]]
== Servers and Cloud Infrastructure

[quote, J. Lubbock,]
Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's
day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the
sky, is by no means a waste of time.


In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

- Deploying a Nagios monitoring server
- Building high-availability services using Heartbeat
- Managing NFS servers and file shares
- Using HAProxy to load-balance multiple web servers
- Managing firewalls with iptables
- Managing EC2 instances
- Managing virtual machines with Vagrant

As powerful as Puppet is for managing the configuration of a single server, its true benefits
become apparent only when controlling networks of many machines. In this chapter we'll
explore ways of using Puppet to help you monitor your infrastructure, create high-availability
clusters, share files across your network, set up automated firewalls, use load-balancing to
get more out of the machines you have, and create new virtual machines in the cloud and
on the desktop.
