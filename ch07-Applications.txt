[[chapter07]]
== Applications

[quote, Luke Kanies,]
The best software in the world only sucks. The worst software is significantly worse
than that.

In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

- Managing Apache servers
- Creating Apache virtual hosts
- Creating Nginx virtual hosts
- Creating MySQL databases and users
- Managing Drupal sites
- Managing Rails applications

Without applications, a server is just a very expensive space heater. This chapter will present
some recipes for managing some specific applications with Puppet: MySQL, Apache, Nginx,
Rails, and Drupal. These are very popular applications, so they should be useful to you in
themselves. However, the patterns and techniques they use are applicable to almost any
software, so you can adapt them to your own purposes without much difficulty.
