== Working with Files and Packages

[quote, Gerald Weinberg,]
If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first
woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.

In this chapter we will cover the following topics:

- Making quick edits to config files
- Using Augeas to automatically edit config files
- Building config files using snippets
- Using ERB templates
- Using array iteration in templates
- Installing packages from a third-party repository
- Setting up an APT package repository
- Setting up a gem repository
- Building packages automatically from source
- Comparing package versions

Almost everything you'll do as a Puppet administrator involves either files or packages.
They are the most important kinds of resources in Puppet and this chapter will help you
to understand them thoroughly, and learn some useful features and patterns to help you
make better use of them.

In this chapter we'll see how to make small edits to files, how to make larger changes in a
structured way using the *Augeas* tool, how to construct files from concatenated snippets, and
how to generate files from templates. We'll also learn how to install packages from additional
repositories, and how to create those repositories.
