== Users and Virtual Resources

[quote, Kent Beck,]
How good the design is doesn't matter near as much as whether the design is
getting better or worse. If it is getting better, day by day, I can live with it forever.
If it is getting worse, I will die.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- Using virtual resources
- Managing users with virtual resources
- Managing users' SSH access
- Managing users' customization files
- Efficiently distributing cron jobs
- Running a command when a file is updated
- Using host resources
- Using multiple file sources
- Distributing directory trees
- Cleaning up old files
- Using schedules with resources
- Auditing resources
- Temporarily disabling resources
- Managing timezones

Users can be a real pain. I don't mean the people, though doubtless that's sometimes true.
But keeping UNIX user accounts and file permissions in sync across a network of machines,
some of them running different operating systems, can be very challenging without some kind
of centralized configuration management.

Consider a situation where a new developer has joined the organization. He needs an account
on every machine along with `sudo` privileges and group memberships, and also needs his
SSH key authorized for a bunch of different accounts. The sysadmin who has to take care of
this manually, will be at the job all day. A sysadmin who uses Puppet will be done in minutes,
heading out for an early lunch.

In this chapter, we'll look at some handy patterns and techniques for managing users and
their associated resources. We'll also see how to schedule resources in Puppet, how to
spread cron jobs around the clock for efficiency, how to handle time zones and +/etc/hosts+
entries, and how to have Puppet collect audit data, so you know when someone's messing
with your machines.
