=== Pre-signing certificates

Because of the security implications, it's best to avoid using autosign if you can help it. In
general, if you want to automate adding a large number of clients, it's better to pre-generate
the certificates on the Puppetmaster and then push them to the client as part of the build
process. You can use `puppet cert --generate <hostname>` to do this.

==== How to do it…

1. Generate a pre-signed certificate for +client1.example.com+ with the following command:
+
.......
puppet cert --generate client1.example.com
.......
+
Puppet will now generate and sign a client certificate in the name of +client1.example.com+.

2. Transfer the three required files; the private key, the client certificate, and the CA
   certificate, to the new client. These are found in the following locations:
+
-----
/etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/client1.example.com.pem
/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/client1.example.com.pem
/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem
-----
+
Transfer these to the corresponding directories on the client, and it will then be
authenticated without the certificate request step. Note that the location of Puppet's
SSL certs varies according to the +ssldir+ setting in +puppet.conf+.
