=== Installing packages from a third-party repository

Most often, you will want to install packages from the main distribution repository, so a simple
+package+ resource will do:

----
package { "exim4": ensure => installed }
----

Sometimes, though, you need a package which is only found in a third-party repository (an
*Ubuntu PPA*, for example). Or it might be that you need a more recent version of a package
than that provided by the distribution, which is available from a third party.

On a manually administered machine, you would normally do this by adding the repository
source configuration to +/etc/apt/sources.list.d+ (and, if necessary, a GPG key for the
repository) before installing the package. We can automate this process easily with Puppet.


==== How to do it…

1. Add the following to your manifest:
+
----
package { "python-software-properties": ensure => installed }

exec { "/usr/bin/add-apt-repository ppa:mathiaz/puppet-backports":
    creates => "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mathiaz-puppet-backportslucid.
    list",
    require => Package["python-software-properties"],
}
----

2. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent --test
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1304773240'
notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/Exec[/usr/bin/add-aptrepository
ppa:mathiaz/puppet-backports]/returns: executed
successfully
notice: Finished catalog run in 5.97 seconds
....

==== How it works…

1. The +python-software-properties+ package provides the command `add-apt-repository`,
   which simplifies the process of adding extra repositories as follows:
+
----
package { "python-software-properties": ensure => installed }
----

2. We then call this command in the +exec+ resource to add the required configuration:
+
----
exec { "/usr/bin/add-apt-repository ppa:mathiaz/puppet-backports":
----

3. To ensure that the +exec+ resource is not run every time Puppet runs, we specify a file
   that the command creates, so that Puppet will skip +exec+ if this file already exists:
+
--
----
creates => "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mathiaz-puppet-backports-lucid.list",
----

You might want to combine this with purging unwanted repository definitions in
+/etc/apt/sources.list.d+, as described in the section on recursive file resources.

==== There's more…

This method of repository handling is specific to Debian and Ubuntu systems, which as we've
said is our reference platform for the book. If you're on a RedHat-based system, you can use
+yumrepo+ resources to manage RPM repositories directly.
