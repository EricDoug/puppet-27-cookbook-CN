=== Using Foreman

*Foreman* is a web-based Puppet management tool like Puppet Dashboard, but more
ambitious. Foreman can manage not only Puppet reporting, nodes and manifest configuration,
but also provision new machines for you. If you need to build large numbers of servers
automatically, or if you frequently rebuild servers, Foreman will help with this process.

==== Getting ready…

1. Add the Foreman package repo to your system, following the instructions at
   http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Installation_instructions.
2. Install the Foreman package as follows:
+
....
# apt-get update
# apt-get install foreman
....

3. You will be prompted to select a database, so choose +mysql+, +pgsql+, or +sqlite+
   depending which one you want to use.
4. Install one of the following packages depending which database you selected in
   the previous step:
+
....
# apt-get install foreman-mysql
# apt-get install foreman-pgsql
# apt-get install foreman-sqlite3
....

5. Copy the file +/etc/foreman/extras/puppet/foreman/files/foremanreport.rb+
   to your Puppet custom report directory (usually +/usr/lib/ruby/1.8./puppet/reports+)
   and name it foreman.rb as follows:
+
....
# cp /etc/foreman/extras/puppet/foreman/files/foreman-report.rb \
     /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/puppet/reports/foreman.rb
....

6. Edit the +foreman.rb+ file to set the URL of your Foreman server as follows:
+
----
# URL of your Foreman installation
$foreman_url="http://cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com:3000"
----

7. Edit your +puppet.conf+ and add the +foreman+ report type to the list of enabled
   reports:
+
----
[master]
reports = store,log,foreman
----

8. Restart the Puppet server to enable this new report.

==== How to do it…

1. Start the Foreman server:
+
....
# /usr/share/foreman/script/server -e production
....

2. Browse to the web interface at the URL you previously set at http://cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com:3000.
+

You should see Foreman's initial welcome page as shown in the following screenshot:

--

3. Now run Puppet on a client:
+
--
....
# puppet agent --test
....

Go to the *Reports* section in the Foreman web interface. You should see a report for
the client where you just ran Puppet as shown in the following screenshot:

--

4. Go to the Dashboard page and you will see an *OVERVIEW* of all your clients (just one
   in this case, but you get the idea).

==== There's more…

We've only touched on the basics of Foreman here. Now that you've got it set up, you can
experiment with the different reports, graphs, and other information available in Foreman.
These become more valuable when you have many hosts to look after, and want to see
statistics about how Puppet is running across the whole network.

The other major feature of Foreman is provisioning: it can use PXEboot and Kickstart to build
virtual or physical servers from scratch, sign your Puppet certificates automatically, and run
Puppet to bring the machine up to production status. For more information about how to do
this, see the Foreman documentation: http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Unattended_installations.


[NOTE]
========
If you decide to use Foreman in production, it's probably worthwhile
setting up an Apache virtual host for it rather than using the Webrick
server that ships with Foreman. Webrick is useful for testing, but it's
not really a production-grade web server.
