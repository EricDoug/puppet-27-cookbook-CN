=== Using public modules

[quote, Tom Lehrer, 'Lobachevsky']
Plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize / Only be sure always to call it, please 'research'.

If in doubt, steal. In many cases when you write a Puppet module to manage some software or
service, you don't have to start from scratch. Community-contributed modules are available at
the *Puppet Forge* site for many popular applications. Sometimes, a community module will be
exactly what you need and you can download and start using it right away. In other cases, you
will need to make some modifications to suit your particular needs and environment.

If you are new to Puppet, it can be a great help to have some existing code to start with.
On the other hand, community modules are often written to be as general and portable as
possible, and the extra code required can make them harder to understand.

In general I would not recommend treating Puppet Forge as a source of 'drop-in' modules
that you can deploy without reading or understanding the code. This introduces an external
dependency to your Puppet infrastructure, and doesn't help advance your understanding and
experience of Puppet. Rather, I would use it as a source of inspiration, help, and examples. A
module taken from Puppet Forge should be a jumping-off point for you to develop and improve
your own modules.

Be aware that a given module may not work on your Linux distribution. Check the +README+ file
that comes with the module to see if your operating system is supported.

==== Getting ready...

1. The easiest way to use Puppet Forge modules is to install the +puppet-module+ tool:
+
....
# gem install puppet-module
Fetching: puppet-module-0.3.2.gem (100%)
******************************************************************

Thank you for installing puppet-module from Puppet Labs!
* Usage instructions: read "README.markdown" or run `puppetmodule
  usage`
* Changelog: read "CHANGES.markdown" or run `puppet-module
  changelog`
* Puppet Forge: visit http://forge.puppetlabs.com/

==== How to do it…

In this example, we'll use +puppet-module+ to find and install a module to manage the Tomcat
application server.

1. Search for a suitable module as follows:
+
....
# puppet-module search tomcat
=====================================
Searching http://forge.puppetlabs.com
-------------------------------------
2 found.
--------
camptocamp/tomcat (0.0.1)
jeffmccune/tomcat (1.0.1)
....

2. In this example we'll install the Jeff McCune version:
+
....
# cd /etc/puppet/modules
# puppet-module install jeffmccune/tomcat
Installed "jeffmccune-tomcat-1.0.1" into directory:
jeffmccune-tomcat
....

3. The module is now ready to use in your manifests: looking at the source code will
   show you how to do this.

==== How it works…

The +puppet-module+ tool simply automates the process of searching and downloading
modules from the Puppet Forge site. You can browse the site to see what's available at:
http://forge.puppetlabs.com/.

==== There's more…

Not all publically available modules are on Puppet Forge. Some other great places to look are
on GitHub:

  - https://github.com/camptocamp
  - https://github.com/example42
