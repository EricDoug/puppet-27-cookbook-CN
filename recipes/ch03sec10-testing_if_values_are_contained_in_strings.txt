=== Testing whether values are contained in strings

Want to know what's in and what's out? Puppet's +in+ keyword can help, with expressions
such as the following:

----
if "foo" in $bar
----

This will be evaluated as +true+ if the string +foo+ is a substring of +$bar+. If +$bar+ is an array,
and if +foo+ is an element of the array, the expression is true. If +$bar+ is a hash, the
expression is +true+ if +foo+ is one of the keys of +$bar+.

==== How to do it…

1. Add the following code to your manifest:
+
----
if $operatingsystem in [ "Ubuntu", "Debian" ] {
    notify { "Debian-type operating system detected": }
} elsif $operatingsystem in [ "RedHat", "Fedora", "SuSE", "CentOS"
] {
    notify { "RedHat-type operating system detected": }
} else {
    notify { "Some other operating system detected": }
}
----

2. Run Puppet:
+
......
# puppet agent --test
Debian-type operating system detected
......


==== There's more…

+in+ expressions can be used not just for +if+ statements or other conditionals, but anywhere
an expression can be used. For example, you can assign the result to a variable as follows:

----
$debianlike = $operatingsystem in [ "Debian", "Ubuntu" ]

if $debianlike {
    $ntpservice = "ntp"
} else {
    $ntpservice = "ntpd"
}
----
