=== Generating manifests from a running system

While `cft` generates Puppet manifests from a system administrator's console session,
*puppet resource* generates Puppet manifests from the existing configuration of a system. For
example, you can have +puppet resource+ generate a manifest that creates all the users
found on the system. This is very useful for taking a snapshot of a working system and getting
its configuration quickly into Puppet.

==== How to do it…

1. To generate the manifest for a particular user, run:
+
----
# puppet resource user john
user { 'john':
    password_min_age => '0',
    password_max_age => '99999',
    uid      => '1002',
    password => '!',
    gid      => '1001',
    groups   => ['git'],
    ensure   => 'present',
    comment  => 'John Arundel',
    home     => '/home/john',
    shell    => '/bin/bash'
}
----

2. For a particular service, run:
+
----
# puppet resource service ntp
service { 'ntp':
    ensure => 'running',
    enable => 'true'
}
----

3. For a package, run:
+
----
# puppet resource package exim4
package { 'exim4':
    ensure => '4.71-3ubuntu1'
}
----

==== There's more…

You can use +puppet resource+ to examine each of the resource types available in Puppet.
In the preceding examples, we generated a manifest for a specific instance of the resource
type, but you can also use +puppet resource+ to dump all instances of the resource:

----
# puppet resource user
user { 'Debian-exim':
    ensure           => 'present',
    uid              => '117',
    gid              => '124',
    home             => '/var/spool/exim4',
    password         => '!',
    password_min_age => '0',
    password_max_age => '99999',
    shell            => '/bin/false'
}

user { 'avahi':
    ensure           => 'present',
    uid              => '104',
    gid              => '111',
    home             => '/var/run/avahi-daemon',
    password         => '*',
    password_min_age => '0',
    comment          => 'Avahi mDNS daemon,,,',
    password_max_age => '99999',
    shell            => '/bin/false'
}
...
----

This will generate a lot of output!
