=== Temporarily disabling resources

Sometimes, you want to disable a resource for the time being, so that it doesn't interfere with
other work. For example, you might want to tweak a configuration file on the server, until you
have the exact settings you want, before checking it into Puppet. You don't want Puppet to
overwrite it with an old version in the meantime, so you can set the +noop+ metaparameter on
the resource as follows:

----
    noop => true,
----

==== How to do it…

1. Add the following to your manifest:
+
----
file { "/tmp/test.cfg":
    content => "Hello, world!\n",
    noop => true,
}
----

2. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent --test
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1306159566'

notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/File[/tmp/test.cfg]/ensure:
is absent, should be file (noop)

notice: Finished catalog run in 0.53 seconds
....

3. Now, remove the +noop+ parameter:
+
----
file { "/tmp/test.cfg":
    content => "Hello, world!\n",
}
----

4. Run Puppet again:
+
....
# puppet agent --test

info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1306159705'

notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/File[/tmp/test.cfg]/ensure:
defined content as '{md5}746308829575e17c3331bbcb00c0898b'

notice: Finished catalog run in 0.52 seconds
....

==== How it works…

The first time we ran Puppet, the +noop+ metaparameter was set to true, so for this particular
resource, it's as if you had run Puppet with the ++--noop++ flag. Puppet noted that the resource
would have been applied, but otherwise did nothing.

In the second case, with +noop+ removed, the resource is applied as normal.
