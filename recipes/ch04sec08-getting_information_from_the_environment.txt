=== Getting information about the environment

[quote, Mark Twain,]
In Paris they simply stared when I spoke to them in French. I never did succeed in
making those idiots understand their language.

Local knowledge can be very useful. Often in a Puppet manifest, you need to know some
local information about the machine you're on. *Facter* is the tool that accompanies Puppet to
provide a standard way of getting information ('facts') from the environment about things like:

- Operating system
- Memory size
- Architecture
- Processor count

[NOTE]
=========
To see a complete list of the facts available on your system, run the command: 

----
# facter
----

While it can be handy to get this information from the command line,
the real power of Facter lies in being able to access these facts in your
Puppet manifests.
=========

==== How to do it…

1. Reference a Facter fact in your manifest like any other variable as follows:
+
----
notify { "This is $operatingsystem version
$operatingsystemrelease, on $architecture architecture, kernel
version $kernelversion": }
----

2. When Puppet runs, it will fill in the appropriate values for the current node:
+
......
notice: This is Ubuntu version 10.04, on i386 architecture,
kernel version 2.6.32
......

==== How it works…

Facter provides an abstraction layer for Puppet, and a standard way for manifests to get
information about their environment. When you refer to a fact in a manifest, Puppet will query
Facter to get the current value, and insert it into the manifest.

==== There's more…

You can also use facts in *ERB* templates. For example, you might want to insert the node's
hostname into a file, or change a config setting for an application based on the memory size
of the node. When you use fact names in templates, remember that they don't need a dollar
sign, because this is Ruby, not Puppet:

----
$KLogPath <%= case kernelversion when "2.6.31" then "/var/run/rsyslog/
kmsg" else "/proc/kmsg" end %>
----
