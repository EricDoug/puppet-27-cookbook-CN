=== Auditing resources

Not every problem has a technical answer. I once had to diagnose a server that was failing to
respond to +`ping`+, SSH, or console connections. I wasn't sure whether it was a hardware or
a network failure.

The mystery was solved when I called the site where the machine was located. They informed
me that two unidentified men had arrived earlier, gone straight to the server room, unplugged
the machine, and simply walked out of the building with it. We later found that there had been
a spate of computer thefts in the area with the same M.O.

The message here is that it's good to know who's doing what to your servers.

Dry-run mode, using the +--noop+ switch, is a simple way to audit any changes to a machine
under Puppet's control. However, Puppet also has a dedicated audit feature, which can report
changes to resources or specific attributes.


==== How to do it…

Define a resource with the audit metaparameter as follows:

----
file { "/etc/passwd":
    audit => [ owner, mode ],
}
----

==== How it works…

The +audit+ metaparameter (a *metaparameter* is a parameter which can be applied to any
resource, not just to specific types) tells Puppet that you want to record and monitor certain
things about the resource. The value can be a list of the parameters you want to audit.

In this case, when Puppet runs, it will now record the owner and mode of the +/etc/passwd+
file. If either of these change, for example, if you run:

....
# chmod 666 /etc/passwd
....

Puppet will pick up this change and log it on the next run:

....
notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/File[/etc/passwd]/mode: audit
change: previously recorded value 644 has been changed to 666
....

==== There's more…

This feature is very useful for auditing large networks for any changes to the machines, either
malicious or accidental. You can use the +tagmail+ reports feature to automatically send
audit change notices by e-mail. It's also very handy for keeping an eye on things that aren't
managed by Puppet, for example application code on production servers. You can read more
about Puppet's auditing capability here:

If you just want to audit everything about a resource, use the following:

----
file { "/etc/passwd":
    audit => all,
}
----
