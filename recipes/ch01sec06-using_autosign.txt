=== Using autosign

In cryptography, as in life, you have to be careful what you sign. Normally, when you introduce
a new client to the Puppetmaster, you need to generate a certificate request on the client, and
then sign it on the master. However, you can skip this step by enabling *autosigning*.

==== How to do it…

Create the file +/etc/puppet/autosign.conf+ on the Puppetmaster with the following
contents: 

----
*.example.com
----

==== How it works…

Puppet checks any incoming certificate requests to see if they match a line from +autosign.conf+.
Any certificate requests from clients with a hostname matching +*.example.com+ will
be automatically signed by the Puppetmaster.

[IMPORTANT]
=============
This is a potential security problem, since it amounts to trusting
any client that can connect to the Puppetmaster. For this reason, autosigning
is not recommended. If you do use it, make sure that the Puppetmaster
is protected by a firewall that allows only approved clients or IP ranges to
connect. A more secure approach is *pre-signing*.
