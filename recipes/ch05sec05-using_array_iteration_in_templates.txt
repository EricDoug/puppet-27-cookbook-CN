=== Using array iteration in templates

In the preceding example we saw that you can use Ruby to interpolate different values in
templates depending on the result of an expression. You can also use a loop to generate
content based on; the elements of an array:


==== How to do it…

1. Add the following to your manifest:
+
----
$ipaddresses = [ '192.168.0.1',
                 '158.43.128.1',
                 '10.0.75.207' ]

file { "/tmp/addresslist.txt":
    content => template("admin/addresslist.erb")
}
----

2. Create the file +/etc/puppet/modules/admin/templates/addresslist.erb+
   with the following contents:
+
----
<% ipaddresses.each do |ip| -%>
IP address <%= ip %> is present.
<% end -%>
----

3. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent --test
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1304766335'
notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/File[/tmp/addresslist.txt]/
ensure: defined content as '{md5}7ad1264ebdae101bb5ea0afef474b3ed'
notice: Finished catalog run in 0.64 seconds
....

4. Check the contents of the generated file as follows:
+
....
# cat /tmp/addresslist.txt
IP address 192.168.0.1 is present.
IP address 158.43.128.1 is present.
IP address 10.0.75.207 is present.
....

==== How it works…

1. In the first line of the template, we reference the array +ipaddresses+, and call the
   corresponding +each+ method as follows:
+
----
<% ipaddresses.each do |ip| -%>
----

2. In Ruby, this creates a loop that will execute once for each element of the array. Each
   time round the loop, the variable +ip+ will be set to the value of the current element.
3. In our example, the +ipaddresses+ array contains three elements, so the following
   line will be executed three times, once for each element:
+
----
IP address <%= ip %> is present.
----

4. This will result in three output lines:
+
----
IP address 192.168.0.1 is present.
IP address 158.43.128.1 is present.
IP address 10.0.75.207 is present.
----

5. The final line ends the loop as follows:
+
----
<% end -%>
----

6. Note that the first and last lines end with +-%>+, instead of just +%>+ as we saw before.
   The effect of the +-+ is to suppress the newline that would otherwise be generated,
   giving us an unwanted blank line in the file.

==== There's more…

Templates can also iterate over hashes, or arrays of hashes as follows:

----
$interfaces = [ { name => 'eth0',
                  ip => '192.168.0.1' },
                { name => 'eth1',
                  ip => '158.43.128.1' },
                { name => 'eth2',
                  ip => '10.0.75.207' } ]

<% interfaces.each do |interface| -%>
Interface <%= interface['name'] %> has the address <%= interface['ip']
%>.
<% end -%>
----

....
Interface eth0 has the address 192.168.0.1.
Interface eth1 has the address 158.43.128.1.
Interface eth2 has the address 10.0.75.207.
....
