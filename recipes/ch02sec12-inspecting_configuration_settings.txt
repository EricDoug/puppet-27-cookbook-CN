=== Inspecting configuration settings

Pop quiz, hotshot!. You already know that Puppet's configuration settings are stored in
puppet.conf, but any parameter not mentioned in that file will take a default value. How can
you see the value of any configuration parameter, regardless of whether or not it's explicitly set
in +puppet.conf+? The answer is to use Puppet's `--genconfig` switch.

==== How to do it…

Run the following command:

......
# puppet --genconfig
......

==== How it works…

This will output every configuration parameter and its value (and there are lots of them). It
does, however, include helpful comments explaining what each parameter does.

To find the specific value you're interested in, you can use `grep` in the following manner:

....
# puppet --genconfig |grep "reportdir ="
    reportdir = /var/lib/puppet/reports
....
