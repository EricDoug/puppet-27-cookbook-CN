=== Detecting compilation errors

[quote, Steven Wright,]
My mechanic told me, 'I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder.

Usually, when there's a problem, we'll want to stop and fix it before continuing. However,
when running in daemon mode, Puppet will ignore any compilation errors in the manifest
and just apply the last known working version from its cache. This behavior is governed by
the +usecacheonfailure+ config setting, and its default setting, true:

......
# puppet --genconfig |grep usecacheonfailure
  # usecacheonfailure = true
......

It's worth noting that when you apply manifests by hand using `puppet agent --test`,
this doesn't happen: Puppet will complain and refuse to do anything if there is an error in
the manifest. That's because the `--test` switch is shorthand for the following options:

......
# puppet agent --onetime --verbose --ignorecache --no-daemonize --no-usecacheonfailure
......

Because +usecacheonfailure+ is on when Puppet runs as a daemon, sometimes you won't
notice mistakes in a manifest for a while, as Puppet keeps on silently running an old version
of the manifest instead of complaining.

==== How to do it…

If you want to change this behavior, set the following value in +puppet.conf+:

----
    usecacheonfailure = false
----

==== How it works…

With this option set, Puppet will immediately complain about errors and refuse to run until
they are corrected.
