=== Creating graphical reports

Let's face it, bosses like pretty pictures. Puppet can produce report data in a form suitable
for processing by the *RRD* (*Round-Robin Database*) graph library, to produce a graphical
representation of metrics such as the runtime on each client.

==== Getting ready

You will need to install the RRD tools and libraries for Ruby on your system. For Ubuntu, run
the following command:

......
# apt-get install rrdtool librrd-ruby
......

==== How to do it…

Add the +rrdgraph+ report type to your +puppet.conf+ as follows:

----
reports = store,rrdgraph
----

==== How it works…

For each run, Puppet will record data in the client's RRD directory (the default is +/var/lib/
puppet/rrd/<clientname>+). It will create graphs in a PNG format for events, resources,
and retrieval time, while the raw data is available to you in the +.rrd+ files if you want to
process it further using third-party RRD tools.

==== There's more…

For more detailed reporting and graphing, you can use Puppet Dashboard.
