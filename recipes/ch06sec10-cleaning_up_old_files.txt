=== Cleaning up old files

We all have to clean house once in a while. Puppet's +tidy+ resource will help you clean
up old or out-of-date files, reducing disk usage. For example, if you have Puppet reporting
enabled as described in the section on <<ch02sec01,Generating reports>>, you might want to regularly
delete old report files.


==== How to do it…

1. Add the following to your manifest:
+
----
tidy { "/var/lib/puppet/reports":
    age     => "1w",
    recurse => true,
}
----

2. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent -–test

==== How it works…

Puppet searches the specified path for any files matching the +age+ parameter: in this case, +1w+
(one week). It also searches subdirectories (+recurse => true+).

Any files matching your criteria will be deleted.

==== There's more…

You can specify file ages in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks, by using a single
character to specify the time unit, like the following:

- 60s
- 180m
- 24h
- 30d
- 4w

You can specify that files greater than a given size should be removed, such as the following:

----
size => "100m",
----

This removes files of 100 megabytes and over. For kilobytes, use k, and for bytes, use b.

[NOTE]
==========
Please note that if you specify both age and size parameters, they
are treated as independent criteria. For example, if you specify the
following files, then Puppet will remove all files older than one day, or
over 512KB in size.

----
  age => "1d",
  size => "512k",
----
==========
