=== Managing timezones

[quote, Ashleigh Brilliant,]
I try to take one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack at once.

Sooner or later, you'll encounter a weird problem, which you'll eventually track down to servers
having different time zones. It's wise to avoid this kind of issue by making sure that all your
servers use the same time zone, whatever their geographical location (GMT is the logical
choice).

Unless a server is solar powered, I can't think of any reason for it to care about the time zone
it's in.

==== How to do it…

1. Create the file +/etc/puppet/modules/admin/manifests/gmt.pp+ with the
   following contents:
+
----
class admin::gmt
{
    file { "/etc/localtime":
        ensure => link,
        target => "/usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT",
    }
}
----

2. Add the following to all nodes:
+
----
include admin::gmt
----

3. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent --test
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1304955158'

info: FileBucket adding /etc/localtime as {md5}02b73b0cf0d96e2f75c
ae56b178bf58e

info: /Stage[main]/Admin::Gmt/File[/etc/localtime]: Filebucketed /
etc/localtime to puppet with sum 02b73b0cf0d96e2f75cae56b178bf58e

notice: /Stage[main]/Admin::Gmt/File[/etc/localtime]/ensure:
ensure changed 'file' to 'link'

notice: Finished catalog run in 1.94 seconds
....

==== There's more…

If you want to use a different timezone, choose the appropriate file in
+/usr/share/zoneinfo+: for example, +US/Eastern+.
