=== E-mailing log messages containing specific tags

If, like most sysadmins, you feel like you don't get enough e-mail, you'll be looking for a way
to generate more. Another type of Puppet report is called +tagmail+. This will e-mail the log
messages to any address you specify.


==== How to do it…

1. Add +tagmail+ to the comma-separated list of reports in +puppet.conf+:
+
----
[master]
reports = store,tagmail
----

2. Add some *tags* and associated e-mail addresses in the file +/etc/puppet/tagmail.conf+. 
For example, this line will e-mail all log messages to me:
+
----
all: john@example.com
----

3. When Puppet runs, you will get an e-mail that looks like the following:
+
----
From: report@cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
Subject: Puppet Report for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
To: john@example.com

Mon Jan 17 08:42:30 -0700 2011 //cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com/
Puppet (info): Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
Mon Jan 17 08:42:30 -0700 2011 //cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com/
Puppet (info): Applying configuration version '1295278949'
----

==== How it works…

Puppet looks at each line in +tagmail.conf+ and sends any messages matching the tag
to the e-mail address specified. The special tag +all+ matches all messages. The tag +err+
matches errors as shown in the following code snippet:

----
err: john@example.com
----

You can list as many rules as you like in the +tagmail.conf+ file, and Puppet will send e-mails
for all rules that match. In the following example, errors go to one address, and web server
related messages go to another:

----
err: puppetmaster@example.com
webserver: webteam@example.com
----

==== There's more…

The +tagmail+ reports are a powerful feature which you may need to experiment with a bit so
that you can get the most out of them. I have given a few tips to help you in the following text.

===== What are tags?

Tags are explained in later <<ch02sec13,Using tags>> in this book, but for reporting purposes,
it's enough to
know that a *tag* can be the name of a node or a class. For example, the tag +webserver+ is
matched if a machine includes the class webserver. You can also add a tag explicitly, using
the +tag+ function as follows:

----
class exim {
    tag("email")
    service { "exim4":
        ensure => running,
        enable => true,
    }
}
----

===== Specifying multiple tags, or excluding tags

You can specify a comma-separated list of tags in +tagmail.conf+, and also exclude certain
tags by using an exclamation point (!).

----
all, !webserver: puppetmaster@example.com
----

===== Sending reports to multiple e-mail addresses

You can send messages to multiple, comma-separated e-mail addresses as shown in the
following code-snippet:

----
err: puppetmaster@example.com, sysadmin@example.com
----
