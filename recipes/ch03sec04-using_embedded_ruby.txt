=== Using embedded Ruby

[quote, Mikkel Bruun,]
Ruby, like fire, is a very useful friend, and a very dangerous enemy.

Templates are a powerful way of using embedded Ruby to help build configuration files
dynamically and iterate over arrays. However, you can embed Ruby in your manifests directly
without having to use a separate file, by calling the +inline_template+ function.

==== How to do it…

Pass your Ruby code to +inline_template+ within the Puppet manifest as follows:

----
cron { "nightly-job":
    command => "/usr/local/bin/nightly-job",
    hour => "0",
    minute => inline_template("<%= hostname.hash.abs % 60 %>"),
}
----

==== How it works…

Anything inside the string passed to +inline_template+ is executed as if it were an ERB
template. That is, anything inside the +<%=+ and +%>+ delimiters will be executed as Ruby code,
and the rest will be treated as a string.
