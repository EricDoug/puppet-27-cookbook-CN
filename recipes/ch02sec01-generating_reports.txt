=== Generating reports

[quote, Pearl Bailey,]
What the world really needs is more love and less paperwork.

Truth is often the first casualty of large infrastructures. If you're managing a lot of machines,
Puppet's reporting facility can give you some valuable information on what's actually
happening out there.

==== How to do it…

To enable reports, just add the following to a client's +puppet.conf+:

----
report = true
----

==== How it works…

With reporting enabled, Puppet will generate a report file on the Puppetmaster, containing
data such as the following:

- Time required to fetch configuration from the Puppetmaster
- Total time of the run
- Log messages output during the run
- List of all resources in the client's manifest
- Whether Puppet changed each resource
- Whether a resource was out of sync with the manifest

By default, these reports are stored in +/var/lib/puppet/reports+, but you can specify a
different destination using the +reportdir+ option. You can either create your own scripts to
process these reports (which are in the standard *YAML* format), or use a tool such as *Puppet
Dashboard* to get a graphical overview of your network.

==== There's more…

A few tips for getting the best from Puppet's reports are explained in the following text.

===== Enabling reports on the command line

If you just want one report, or you don't want to enable reporting for all clients, you can add
the `--report` switch to the command line when you run Puppet manually:

......
# puppet agent --test --report
......

You can also see some statistics about a Puppet run by supplying the `--summarize` switch
as follows:

......
# puppet agent --test --summarize
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1306169315'
notice: Finished catalog run in 0.58 seconds
Changes:
Events:
Resources:
             Total: 7
Time:
  Config retrieval: 3.65
        Filebucket: 0.00
          Schedule: 0.00
......

===== Logging Puppet messages to syslog

Puppet can also send its log messages to the Puppetmaster's *syslog*, so that you can analyze
them with standard syslog tools. To enable this, set the following option in the Puppetmaster's
+puppet.conf+:

----
[master]
reports = store,log
----

The default report type is +store+ (it writes the reports to +/var/lib/puppet/reports+), and
+log+ tells Puppet to also send messages to the syslog.
