=== Using ERB templates

A *template* is a text file with a college degree. It can do calculations, execute Ruby code, or
reference the values of variables from your Puppet manifests. Anywhere you might deploy a
text file using Puppet, you can use a template instead. In the simplest case, a template can
just be a static text file. More usefully, you can insert variables into it using *ERB*
(*embedded Ruby*) syntax. For example:

----
    <%= name %>, this is a very large drink.
----

If the template is used in a context where the variable +$name+ contains 
+Zaphod Beeblebrox+, the template will evaluate as follows:

----
    Zaphod Beeblebrox, this is a very large drink.
----

This simple technique is very useful for generating lots of files that only differ in the values
of one or two variables such as virtual hosts -- and for inserting values into a script such
as database names and passwords. In this example, we'll use an ERB template to insert a
password into a backup script.

==== How to do it…

1. Create the file +/etc/puppet/modules/admin/templates/backup-mysql.sh+
   with the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/mysqldump -uroot -p<%= mysql_password %> --all-databases \
| /bin/gzip > /backup/mysql/all-databases.sql.gz
----

2. Add the following to your manifest:
+
----
$mysql_password = "secret"
    file { "/usr/local/bin/backup-mysql":
    content => template("admin/backup-mysql.sh"),
    mode    => "755",
}
----

3. Run Puppet:
+
....
# puppet agent --test
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Caching catalog for cookbook.bitfieldconsulting.com
info: Applying configuration version '1308670971'
notice: /Stage[main]//Node[cookbook]/File[/usr/local/bin/backupmysql]/
ensure: defined content as '{md5}5853b6d4dd72420e341fa7ecb8
91ad43'
notice: Finished catalog run in 0.96 seconds
....

4. Check that Puppet has correctly inserted the password into the template:
+
--
....
# cat /usr/local/bin/backup-mysql
....

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/mysqldump -uroot -psecret --all-databases \
| /bin/gzip > /backup/mysql/all-databases.sql.gz
----
--

==== How it works…

Wherever a variable is referenced in the template, such as +<%= mysql_password %>+
Puppet will replace it with the corresponding value: +secret+.

==== There's more…

In the example, we only used one variable in the template, but you can have as many as you
like. These can also be facts, such as the following:

----
ServerName <%= fqdn %>
----

or Ruby expressions such as:

----
MAILTO=<%= emails.join(',') %>
----

or any Ruby code you want such as:

----
ServerAdmin <%= sitedomain == 'coldcomfort.com' ? 'seth@coldcomfort.com'
 : 'flora@poste.com' %>
----
