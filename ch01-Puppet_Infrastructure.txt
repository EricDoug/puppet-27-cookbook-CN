== Puppet Infrastructure

[quote, Popular Mechanics (1949), ]
Computers in the future may have as few as 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh
only 1.5 tons.

In this chapter, we will cover:

- Using version control
- Using commit hooks
- Deploying changes with Rake
- Configuring Puppet's file server
- Running Puppet from cron
- Using autosign
- Pre-signing certificates
- Retrieving files from Puppet's filebucket
- Scaling Puppet using Passenger
- Creating a decentralized Puppet architecture

Some of the recipes in this book represent best practices as agreed upon by the Puppet
community. Others are tips and tricks that will make it easier for you to work with Puppet, or
introduce you to features that you may not have been previously aware of. Some recipes are
short cuts which I wouldn't recommend you use as standard operating procedure, but may be
useful in emergencies. Finally, there are some experimental recipes that you may like to try, but
are only useful or applicable in very large infrastructures or otherwise unusual circumstances.


I hope that, by reading through and thinking about the recipes presented here, you will gain a
deeper and broader understanding of how Puppet works and how you can use it to help you
build better infrastructures. Only you can decide whether a particular recipe is appropriate
for you and your organization, but I hope this collection will inspire you to experiment, find out
more, and most of all -- have fun using Puppet!

[TIP]
===============
You'll see that throughout the examples in this book, most of the commands
are run as the root user. If you prefer to administer systems with a normal
user account and sudo, please do it this way instead.
===============

Because Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Red Hat, and CentOS differ in the specific
details of package names, configuration file paths, and many other things, I have decided
that for reasons of space and clarity the best approach for this book is to pick one distribution
(Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid) and stick with it. However, Puppet runs on almost every operating
system there is, so you should have very little trouble adapting the recipes to your own
favored OS and distribution.

At the time of writing this book, Puppet 2.7 was the latest stable version available, and
consequently I have chosen that as the reference version of Puppet used. However, the
syntax of Puppet commands changes every so often; so be aware that while older versions
of Puppet are still perfectly usable, they may not support all of the features and syntax
described in this book.
